# defaults file for ansible-role-crowdstrike-falcon-sensor


# Installation options:
# ---
#
# The installation instructions for Falcon on linux require that the client download the sensor package
# from the Falcon console's "Sensor Downloads" screen, and place either on the host or somewhere reachable
# by the host.   The installer is also required to copy down the Customer ID Checksum (CID) from the
# "Sensor Downloads" screen for use during installation.   This role requires both of these parameters in the
# following formats:
#
# A full http/https/ftp download url to the specific package that is to be installed on the remote host.   It is
# assumed that the url has been locked down to the host or a set of hosts tied to the customer's Crowdstrike Falcon
# account.
# cs_falcon_download_url: https://my-personal-dropbox/falcon-sensor-4.x.deb
#
# CID is required for Falcon Sensor versions > 4.0.   We assume the version being installed
# is > 4.0, so providing CID is required to run this role.
# cs_falcon_cid: 12345-ABC

# The following are optional parameters:
#
# Falcon requires that a master image remove the agent ID so that instances spun up from the master get
# unique AIDs.   If installing this role on a base AMI or master image, set this flag to `true`.
cs_falcon_remove_agent_id: false
